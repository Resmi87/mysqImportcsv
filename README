Following are the assumptions taken:
1) The Source_File need to be placed in the location as specified against "secure_file_priv" in my.ini, and please ensure you have write privilege to the location.
2) Please ensure that the Source_file name is contact_list.csv
3) Please ensure that the root/admin user details is present in .mylogin.cnf, as the MySQL scripts are run using .mylogin.cnf
4) Please ensure that MySQL has been added to the Path variable

Instructions:

1) Please copy the files to a location in your computer
2) In cmd, go to the location where the files are
3) Run Load.bat file, this will run the related files to create client_db, load data and output reports (Data_Integrity.csv and Updated_Contact_List.csv)
 
Credits: http://joezack.com/2008/10/20/mysql-capitalize-function/ for Initcap function slightly modified to suit the requirement. Had this function on-hand as part of studying.

Notes on Requirements given:
1) Based on the provided source_file data, Fax number is classified under landline and hence prefixed with 09.
2) Since the name field in table Phone is of 64 char, either of first_name or last name will be chosen instead of concatenating.
3) Changed the table definition of Phone to include 'Fax' in Type, as it is given in the requirement that exported data should be consistent with the imported one.
4) For the same reason mentioned above the duplicate entries in home/work or work/mobile is not removed but output-ed to Data_Integrity Report.
5) The Notes field contains special character, but since it is user field, this has not been removed but output-ed to Data_Integrity Report.
